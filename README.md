# Overview

This is an introduction to Kotlin. The main function explores variables and types, conditionals, loops, functinos, classes, collections, and when statements. Follow along to get a good grasp of Kotlin basics.

My purpose in putting this together was to introduce myself to Kotlin and its capabilities. Kotlin is becoming more popular, so it's good to keep up with this new language.

# Development Environment

I used, and highly recommend, IntelliJ by JetBrains to write and run this Kotlin code. At first, I tried running through VSCode, which required downloading the Java sependencies separately. That didn't go so well, so I took the easy path and downloaded IntelliJ. If you want to write anything in Kotlin and you're on a Mac, use IntelliJ. It'll make your life easier.
